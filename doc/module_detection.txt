FUNCTIONS
    ImageAnalysis(nx, ny, imageName)
        ImageAnalysis is calling the octave file calculating the probability that
        there is labware(s) in the actual picture. Because the x/y system of the image is
        different from the x/y system of the platform, corrections are made and add the necessary
        mm if nx and ny are larger than 1.
        INPUT : square numbers on the deck (nx/and ny are provided by planner) and the imageName
        OUTPUT: Data set is store in the DB


        This function also recalculates x-y position on the platform using nx and ny.
             x-y values calculated from pictures are in the standard format
             Those values are, on the platform, y-x because of the design. Below
             is the code to correct that.
                ny = number of square in y [0:3]
                nx = number of square in x [0:4]

             y_plateforme = round(item["y"]+yPhotoRes*ny,3)
             x_plateforme = round(xPhotoRes*(nx+1)-item["x"],3)

    SplitRosFile(RosFile, fileToData)
        Input : example.txt file output by pcl_to_windows ros node.
        The output is 6 .txt files [x y z r g b] which are then read by function
        CreateMatFile().
