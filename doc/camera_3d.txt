CLASSES
    Barrier
    Camera3d

    class Barrier
     |  Barrier class is used to wait until the 2D image is
     |  correctly saved in jpg format before continuing the analysis.
     |  To pass the barrier, both function must call it
     |  (callback_command & callback_3d_capture)
     |
     |  Methods defined here:
     |
     |  __init__(self, n)
     |      Built the Barrier Object.
     |      :param n: Number of elements to be connected to the Barrier
     |                  before continuing the code.
     |      :return: returns nothing
     |
     |  wait(self)
     |      Wait until every called to Barrier were made.

    class Camera3d
     |  Methods defined here:
     |
     |  __init__(self)
     |      Initialise Camera3d object. It starts relevant subscriber and publisher needed
     |      for the 3D cartography to work properly.
     |
     |
     |      Publisher:
     |      Subscriber: /Do_cartography => Send command to start analysis using the nx/ny value [square number to be analysed]
     |                  /rgb_image      => 2D image from DS325
     |
     |  callback_3d_capture(self, msg)
     |      Callback called each time an image is available from the DS325
     |
     |  callback_command(self, msg)
     |      Callback called each time a demand for the cartography analysis.
     |
     |  imageAnalysis(self, nx, ny)
     |      imageAnalysis calls function from ModuleDetection.
     |      - SplitRosFile -> split the .txt file into x y z r g b data. Then, an octave file is called
     |          IOT save those data into one .mat file
     |          INPUT : file name / path where x y z r g b data will be stored
     |          OUTPUT: .mat file (example.mat)
     |      - ImageAnalysis -> Perform 2D and 3D analysis on the current data set (octave file)
     |          INPUT : Square coordinate (nx / ny) and file (.jpg and .mat ) name. Both name must be the same
     |          OUTPUT: If something is found, data are stored in the DB
